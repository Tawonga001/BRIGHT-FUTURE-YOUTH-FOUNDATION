# BRIGHT-FUTURE-YOUTH-FOUNDATION
A platform for youth empowerment, mentorship and education outreach by Bright Future Youth Foundation.
The changes that were made are; making my repository public instead of private as it being private provided difficulty when attempting to access my website and then, 
I had to link or clone it to Gitub Desktop. Then finally making changes to the website and committing those changes.
Below are screenshots on how the website looks on different devices
